* Download a zip archive from the github page.
* Un-zip the archive.
* Put the the `WaveTiles.x` to the MMD window
* Put the the `WaveTilesController.pmx` to the MMD window
* Click `Play` Button

How:
-----------
* Put a `Media/Experiment by IQ.wav` to the `Tools` Folder
* Drag and drop the `wav` onto `run.exe`
* Wait for output of image

* Rename it to `fft.png`
* Copy and phase `png` to `WaveTiles/Textures` instead of old texture
